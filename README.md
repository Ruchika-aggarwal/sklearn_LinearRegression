It is a basic implementaion of linear regression algorithm with the inbuilt methods of sklearn library of python.

Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. This library, which is largely written in Python, is built upon NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib. 

1.Loading of dataset-sklearn.datsets 
2.splitting of dataset into train and test 
3.data-sklearn.model_selection Linear regression class object is initialised for fitting(training of alogorithm),predicting the output based on test samples and testing the score(accuracy of the model). 
4.Other libraries used are numpy,pandas and matplotlib.
